    <a href="https://nwhacks2019.github.io/frontend/" target="_blank"><b>Give+Seek</b></a> is a place where the community comes together in times of need. People have the opportunity to provide unconditionally to those who need assistance, and those in need can ask without hesitation from those who are kind.

  <p>
    The project was created during January 26-27, 2019 for <a href="https://www.nwhacks.io/" target="_blank">nwHacks 2019</a>.

  <h1>The Inspiration</h1>

  <p>
    The recent government shutdown in the US brought hardships on... <!-- TODO -->
  </p>

  <p class="pt-3">
    On a more sombre note, during the attacks on the United States of America on September 11, 2001, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/man-who-grounded-4-000-planes-on-9-11-was-on-first-day-5838772" target="_blank">over 4,000 planes</a> were grounded all over North America and unable to fly. Over <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-and-911" target="_blank">200 planes</a> were diverted to Canada, 34 of which landed in Vancouver.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the areas where thousands of people waited, terrified and alone, communities reached out with warm hands to support and help wherever they could. <a href="https://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/canada/9-11-day-planes-stood-still/" target="_blank">Gander, Newfoundland</a> was the most well-known case; the town of only 10,000 provided medicine, water, food, and shelter to a stranded group of 10,000 more. Schools, shelters, local buildings, and any feasible spaces were repurposed for temporary shelter. A pregnant woman was taken care of. Doctors and high school students alike sprang to help any way they could.

    <p>
      At a time when the world, for many, seemed to be falling apart, many Canadians, in Gander, Halifax and many other places, came together to open their houses, stores and hearts to perfect strangers. And I dare to predict that neither the Canadians nor the strangers will ever forget the experience.

  <p>
    The hospitality, compassion, and welcoming love of the town of Gander for those who needed help was incomparable. Our question was this: <em>How can we provide people with ways to continue helping those in need in our community?</em>

  <h1>Positioning</h1>

  <h1>Objectives</h1>

  <p>
    The potential of human connection cannot be understated. Those who have need may come to seek for what they need, when they need it most. They seek for kindness from those who have compassion to spare. Those who have resources to help others may give back to the community that cares for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are here for each other.
